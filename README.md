## The Foundation

### Value Proposition

* Skylite is a simple yet powerful web application built with Dash that provides up-to-date weather forecasts from multiple sources.

* It aims to empower users with immediate access to crucial weather data, helping them plan their day with confidence, whether for travel, outdoor activities, or simply staying informed about local conditions.

* Its intuitive interface and visual data representation make complex weather data easily digestible for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Skip The Setup: Just Click
Click [SkyLite](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Machini/WeatherLens)

### How to Use SkyLite

Using SkyLite is straightforward:

1. In the input box, type the name of the city and its two-letter country code (e.g., "London, GB", "New York City, US", "Tokyo, JP").

2. Choose your preferred weather data provider (AccuWeather or OpenWeather) from the dropdown menu.

3. Click the "Search" button to fetch and display the latest weather forecast for your chosen location and source.

### Detailed Configuration Steps
To set up and run SkyLite locally, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**

1.  Python 3.11.4 (or compatible version)

2.  pip (Python package installer)

3.  API Keys for AccuWeather and OpenWeather: For secure deployment (e.g., on Hugging Face Spaces) and to prevent exposing your keys in a public repository, these are loaded from environment variables.  
For further details on obtaining and configuring these APIs, please refer to the **API Documentation section** below.

    * **For Deployment (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces):** You will set `ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY` and `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` as "Secrets" in your Space's settings.  
    For detailed instructions on how to add secrets, please refer to the official [Hugging Face Spaces documentation on Secrets and Variables](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview#configure-secrets-and-variables).
    
    * **For Local Development:** Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (and ensure it's in your `.gitignore`) with the following content:
    
        ```
        ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY
        OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
        ```
        
        You will also need to install `python-dotenv` (`pip install python-dotenv`). To load these environment variables locally, add the following lines at the very beginning of your `SkyLite.py` file:
        
        ```python
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        load_dotenv()
        ```
<br>

**Installation**

Step 1: *Clone the repository:*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asmit-cloud/SkyLite.git
cd SkyLite
```

Step 2: *Create a virtual environment (recommended):*

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Step 3: *Install dependencies:*

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Running the Application**

1. **Ensure assets folder exists:** Create an assets folder in the same directory as SkyLite.py.

2. **Set Up API keys:**

API keys are loaded from environment variables for secure management.

* **For local development:** Create and configure a `.env` file in your project's root directory, as detailed in the **Prerequisites** section.
    
* **For deployment (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces):** Set your API keys as secrets in the platform's settings, as described in the **Prerequisites** section.

3. **Add icons:**

The application expects weather icons to be present in `assets/Image/AccuWeatherIcons` and `assets/Image/OpenWeatherIcons`.
<br>
You'll need to populate these folders with the necessary images as referenced in the SkyLite.py file. (e.g., SearchButtonImage.png, AW_RGB_R.png, and the various weather icons).


You can use placeholder images if you don't have the exact icons.

4. **Run the Dash app:**

```bash
python SkyLite.py
```

The application will typically be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.

### Usage

After launching the application, you can interact with it as follows:

1. **Input Search Query:** Type the name of a city and its country code (e.g., "London, GB") into the search bar.

2. **Select Data Source:** Use the dropdown to switch between "Open Weather" and "Accu Weather" to get the data from different providers.

3. **View Results:** The application will display a series of weather cards showing hourly forecasts.

4. **Attribution Details:** Click on "Sources and Attribution Details for Images" in the footer to reveal the sources of the icons and other assets used in the application for that particular weather source.



## Unveiling the Features


### Key Features

**Global Weather Search:** Easily search for weather information by entering a city and country code.

**Multiple Data Sources:** Choose between weather data from OpenWeather and AccuWeather for comprehensive insights.

**Detailed Forecasts:** View hourly forecasts including temperature, conditions, precipitation probability, and daylight status.

**Interactive Graphs:** Visualize temperature, humidity, dew point, and wind speed trends over time with interactive plots.

**Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

**Attribution Transparency:** Clearly displays attribution for all data sources and icons used.


### Usage Examples

1. *Simple Scenarios*

**Checking Current City Weather:** Open the app, type London, UK into the search bar, select Open Weather from the dropdown, and hit enter or click the search icon. You'll instantly see the 3-hour interval forecast cards and interactive graphs.

**Comparing Data Sources:** After viewing London, UK with Open Weather, simply switch the dropdown to Accu Weather to see how the forecast might differ, without needing to re-enter the city.

2. *Advanced Scenarios*

The interactive Plotly graphs allow you to zoom in on specific time periods by clicking and dragging, or pan across the data. Double-click to reset the view. This is useful for analyzing specific hourly trends.
